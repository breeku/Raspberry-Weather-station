# ESP8266_NodeJS_React

## How to use

#### **Note that you can go about this multiple ways.**

Now how I would do this is:
1. **Enable SSH on your Raspberry**
2. *Find your raspberry's IP (IP scanner, or if you have access to the raspberry's terminal, ifconfig)*
3. **Install Putty for SSH Access**
4. **Clone this repository to your Raspberry**
5. **Follow the folder's instructions**

For a lack of a demo, here's a picture how the end result should look like.
